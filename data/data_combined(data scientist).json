We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.\n\nWhat the role is\nData scientists in GovTech help crack challenging problems through the use of machine learning and other computational methods on... government data. You would have the opportunity to work across domains like citizen engagement, healthcare, transport and operations.\n\nAs a data scientist, you will:\n\n\u00b7 Improve public service delivery and policy by extracting insights from government data\n\n\u00b7 Work closely with product managers, data scientists and engineers to develop, test and deploy new data products\n\n\u00b7 Write production-quality code and work with engineers to put models into operation\n\n\u00b7 Learn new things and impart knowledge with other team members in a multi-disciplinary team\n\nAdditionally, more senior data scientists will be expected to:\n\n\u00b7 Establish best practices\n\n\u00b7 Share your expertise and mentor other data scientists\n\n\u00b7 Help with recruiting.\n\nYou are not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.\n\nWhat it is like working here\nWe build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people\u2019s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.\n\n\u00b7 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.\n\n\u00b7 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.\n\n\u00b7 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.\n\n\u00b7 Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.\n\nWhat we are looking for\nWe work mostly in Python, JavaScript and Scala. However, we do not require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Proficiency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.\n\nWe look for people who:\n\n\u00b7 Have experience working with data and machine learning to solve problems\n\n\u00b7 Have a demonstrated ability to build software\n\n\u00b7 Can write code to solve abstract problems\n\n\u00b7 Can talk and reason about code with other engineers\n\n\u00b7 Take the initiative to make things happen\n\n\u00b7 Want to work for the public good.\n\n", "extensions": ["15 days ago", "Full\u2013time"], "detected_extensions": {"posted_at": "15 days ago", "schedule_type": "Full\u2013time"}, "job_id": "eyJqb2JfdGl0bGUiOiJEYXRhIFNjaWVudGlzdCAoQXJ0aWZpY2lhbCBJbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UgUGxhdGZvcm1zKSIsImNvbXBhbnlfbmFtZSI6IkdvdmVybm1lbnQgVGVjaG5vbG9neSBBZ2VuY3kiLCJjb21wYW55X21pZCI6Ii9nLzExZ2gwNTI4bnEiLCJhZGRyZXNzX2NpdHkiOiJTaW5nYXBvcmUiLCJhZGRyZXNzX3N0YXRlIjoiIiwiaHRpZG9jaWQiOiI0NVNUYjV6M2h0NzNhUnN4QUFBQUFBPT0iLCJ1dWxlIjoidytDQUlRSUNJSlUybHVaMkZ3YjNKbCIsImdsIjoic2ciLCJobCI6ImVuIiwiZmMiOiJFb3NDQ3N3QlFVNVZYMDV4VkZSaldscGxhM015YkdOdmRWQXhjMjVrUVd4Wk4wdEVOWEZ4TTJsSWNrNWpURXBoU1ZVMFgzUkpVbE4yV1doV01VczJTMGROYTJFMmVVNDFWMnBXWjFKd2NGTTVWV2w1YVdGQ1ExVTFNaTEyWTE5NlpWVjJSazlHTW01SGVFNTRMV1JhVkdOUFYydG5XazkzUWxGd09FcEhaVVl0Ym05M1l5MTNUM2MyYUVNeWQyVnBhMDVYYzNoRVEwdGpZV3hSZGpoWVFrTjFXbU5VV1ZGeGFHRjZZWGM0UmtReFlXVmtYMFo1UWxKSGNIUnNWWFZ5WkhSS2VrMVViblZZU3preWRsbElORWxvRWhaV2JtMURXVTh0VkV4T1MwWjBVV0Z3YTJGRWQwRm5HaUpCVDAxWlVuZERRbmhCWkZCaVIyYzNiVUpDTFdkTFdHOUVOWEEyU0ZwT05UaFIiLCJmY3YiOiIzIiwiZmNfaWQiOiJmY181NiIsImFwcGx5X2xpbmsiOnsidGl0bGUiOiJBcHBseSBvbiBOZXV2b28iLCJsaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9zZy5uZXV2b28uY29tL3ZpZXcvP2lkPWViNzZjOGVhMWIxMVx1MDAyNnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1nb29nbGVfam9ic19hcHBseVx1MDAyNnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z29vZ2xlX2pvYnNfYXBwbHlcdTAwMjZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPW9yZ2FuaWMifX0="}, {"title": "AI/ML - Annotation Analyst- Thai Language Specialist", "company_name": "Apple", "location": "Singapore", "via": "via LinkedIn", "description": "Summary\n\nImagine what you could do here.

We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data, the first goal is to therefore, examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data, peptide identification, inferred protein). Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source. Thirdly, missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction, imputation approaches... usually ignore the batch covariate, such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.\nYour primary role is in would be to help examine the extent of this problem.
