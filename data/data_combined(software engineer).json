We are looking for independent and self-driven individuals who embrace challenges and love to explore new technologies and platforms. At Hubble, we believe the future is in our products, and the future of our products will be in your hands.\n\nYour current mood:\n\nYou have spent the past 3-5 years as a Staff Software Engineer. However, the bureaucracy of the large corporate is stifling and you are starting to feel that you can contribute more. You want to make an impact at work and make a dent in the universe. You feel that you have talents in abundance but they are not recognised. You are sick and tired of them telling you your time will come, there are many before you. Your talents should NOT be measured by your age, corporate seniority, and bureaucracy. You want to step up to the plate now. You want to bat for home... run.\n\nWhat Hubble will give you:\n\nHubble is built by a team of talented, driven, and ambitious individuals. We do not subscribe to conventions. We do not let history and traditions dictate and limit our dreams to shape the world. We adopt the same mindset with our hiring. We are looking for the best and we want to bet on you. In this position, we want to groom you to take on a leadership position. Join only if you want to take on the challenge of leading and growing your own team.
