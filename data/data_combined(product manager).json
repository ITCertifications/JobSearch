We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.\n\nJoin us as we support Singapore\u2019s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.\n\nWho We Are\n\nGovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.\n\nWhat The Role Is\n\nProduct managers help make sure the right things get done. At a high level, this means establishing a clear vision for what a... product should be and what needs to be done to get there. On a day to day basis, this means handling all the different facets of a project and making sure they are coordinated. And at the core, this means building a foundation of knowledge across user needs, technical constraints, and design goals so you can act as a bridge across all of them.\n\nConcretely This Means\n\u2022 Making good product decisions\n\u2022 Working with designers to create intuitive user experiences\n\u2022 Creating multiple proposals for the many forms a product can take\n\u2022 Driving the team toward consensus on what the product should be\n\u2022 Understanding users better than anyone else\n\u2022 Conducting user studies to understand their needs and problems\n\u2022 Analysing data to uncover usage patterns that inform product decisions\n\u2022 Researching the industry to understand existing solutions\n\u2022 Work closely with the engineering team\n\u2022 Translating the product strategy into detailed, actionable plans for business and engineering teams\n\u2022 Communicating across teams\n\u2022 Explaining technical considerations to non-technical audiences\n\u2022 Public-speaking, giving presentations and writing papers\n\u2022 Identifying key stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners and the broader tech community, and convincing them to give their support\n\u2022 Coordinating efforts across multiple functions including marketing, legal and finance\n\u2022 Keeping things organised\n\u2022 Running efficient meetings to keep people updated and make good decisions\n\u2022 Prioritising, planning, and tracking what needs to be done\n\u2022 Documenting key information and decisions about the product\n\nWhat It Is Like Working Here\n\nWe build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people\u2019s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.\n\u2022 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.\n\u2022 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.\n\u2022 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.\n\u2022 Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.\n\nWhat We Are Looking For\n\nThe customers for our products are normally agency users, which means that prior public service experience will help. A disciplined approach and strong problem-solving instincts are fundamental to succeed. Your aptitude for completing the tasks and attitude to continuous learning are more valued than any formal certification.\n\nWe Look For People Who\n\u2022 Have solid communication and stakeholder management skills\n\u2022 Can analyse and use data to solve problems\n\u2022 Have an interest in data science and machine learning\n\u2022 Have good design sense\n\u2022 Have experience writing code\n\u2022 Take initiative to make things happen\n\u2022 Want to work for the public good", "extensions": ["28 days ago", "Full\u2013time"], "detected_extensions": {"posted_at": "28 days ago", "schedule_type": "Full\u2013time"}, "job_id": "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"}, {"title": "Product Manager", "company_name": "Standard Chartered Bank", "location": "Singapore", "via": "via Laimoon.com", "description": "About Standard Chartered\nWe are a leading international bank focused on helping people and companies prosper across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nTo us, good performance is about much more than turning a profit.

We also develop the Smart Nation infrastructure and applications, and facilitate collaboration with citizens and businesses to co-develop technologies.\n\nJoin us as we support Singapore\u2019s vision of building a Smart Nation - a nation of possibilities empowered through info-communications technology and related engineering.\n\nWho we are\nGovTech's Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) division uses technology and data to help deliver high-quality digital services to citizens and businesses in Singapore. We build software products for government agencies to better understand and use their data to improve operations and decision making.\n\nWhat the role is\nProduct managers help make sure the right things get done. At a high level, this means establishing a clear vision for what a... product should be and what needs to be done to get there. On a day to day basis, this means handling all the different facets of a project and making sure they are coordinated. And at the core, this means building a foundation of knowledge across user needs, technical constraints, and design goals so you can act as a bridge across all of them.\n\nConcretely this means:\n\u2022 Making good product decisions\n\u2022 Working with designers to create intuitive user experiences\n\u2022 Creating multiple proposals for the many forms a product can take\n\u2022 Driving the team toward consensus on what the product should be\n\u2022 Understanding users better than anyone else\n\u2022 Conducting user studies to understand their needs and problems\n\u2022 Analysing data to uncover usage patterns that inform product decisions\n\u2022 Researching the industry to understand existing solutions\n\u2022 Work closely with the engineering team\n\u2022 Translating the product strategy into detailed, actionable plans for business and engineering teams\n\u2022 Communicating across teams\n\u2022 Explaining technical considerations to non-technical audiences\n\u2022 Public-speaking, giving presentations and writing papers\n\u2022 Identifying key stakeholders, including government agencies, industry partners and the broader tech community, and convincing them to give their support\n\u2022 Coordinating efforts across multiple functions including marketing, legal and finance\n\u2022 Keeping things organised\n\u2022 Running efficient meetings to keep people updated and make good decisions\n\u2022 Prioritising, planning, and tracking what needs to be done\n\u2022 Documenting key information and decisions about the product\n\nWhat it is like working here\nWe build products that serve a variety of agency users, who use them to solve highly meaningful problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people\u2019s lives. We are here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.\n\u2022 Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.\n\u2022 Reliable Productization - To scale an idea, a prototype or a Minimum Viable Product to a software product, we scrutinize and commit to its usability, reliability, scalability and maintainability.\n\u2022 Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having ideas on how things should be done and taking responsibility for seeing them through. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.\n\u2022 Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.\n\nWhat we are looking for\nThe customers for our products are normally agency users, which means that prior public service experience will help. A disciplined approach and strong problem-solving instincts are fundamental to succeed. Your aptitude for completing the tasks and attitude to continuous learning are more valued than any formal certification.\n\nWe look for people who:\n\u2022 Have solid communication and stakeholder management skills\n\u2022 Can analyse and use data to solve problems\n\u2022 Have an interest in data science and machine learning\n\u2022 Have good design sense\n\u2022 Have experience writing code\n\u2022 Take initiative to make things happen\n\u2022 Want to work for the public good", "extensions": ["16 days ago", "Full\u2013time"], "detected_extensions": {"posted_at": "16 days ago", "schedule_type": "Full\u2013time"}, "job_id": "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"}, {"title": "Product Manager, Senior (Big Data)", "company_name": "Binance", "location": "Singapore", "via": "via Bayt.com", "description": "Binance is the global blockchain company behind the world\u2019s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and users, serving a greater mission to accelerate cryptocurrency adoption and increase the freedom of money.\n\nAre you looking to be a part of the most influential company in the blockchain industry and contribute to the crypto-currency revolution that is changing the world?\n\nResponsibilities:\n\u2022 Responsible for Binance internal product design and planning, draft PRD requirements and interactive documents, and design product Roadmap.\n\u2022 Actively provide industry insights, promote innovation in products and services, and continuously improve efficiency and rationality in product functions.\n\u2022 Responsible for cross-functional and cross-department communication and coordination to ensure product quality and progress, and complete related product goals.\n\u2022 Support related business needs and achieves business goals with internal and external partners.\n\u2022 Transform business... requirements/plans into feasible product requirements/priorities.\n\u2022 Work closely with the Dev and QA teams to ensure the smooth delivery of the solution.\n\u2022 Analyze product performance data and collect user feedback to optimize user experience.\n\nRequirements:\n\u2022 More than 5 years of working experience in Internet products, and has experience with independently product design and implementation of complicated business logic;\n\u2022 Full-time enrolment of bachelor degree or above, working experience in mainstream Internet companies is preferred;
