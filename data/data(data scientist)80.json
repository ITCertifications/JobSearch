We think there is value in early intervention. Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data, the first goal is to therefore, examine at what point resolution of batch effects provides greatest positive impact (raw data, peptide identification, inferred protein). Secondly, ambiguously mapped peptides are often discarded prior to protein mapping but also carry useful information regarding batch-effect loading, this project examines the cost, in terms of being able to estimate batch effect, of discarding this information source. Thirdly, missing values are common in proteomics data and are usually resolved by imputation prior to batch effect correction, imputation approaches... usually ignore the batch covariate, such that batch effects can creep into proteins due to careless imputation.\nYour primary role is in would be to help examine the extent of this problem. In collaboration with our lab members, you will also help develop solutions.\nIn addition, you will also partake in various machine learning and AI-driven initiatives involving the use of MS data in clinical diagnostics.
